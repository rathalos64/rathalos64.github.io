Well, I have not intended to ever starting blogging nor have I any recollection
of the decision process behind it. But here I am. Right before the valley of 
blog entries over blog entries to come, meandering through highly interesting and optimized
topics that I will describe in depth and cover almost academically.

Yeah, uhm, no. I don't have the time for that much less patience to cover everything
comprehensively. Instead, I will just this platform and my time to simply share
some thoughts about literally anything. If someone is interested in what they can expect,
here are some interests I have right now:
* Computer Science
* Data Science, especially Statistics
* Chess (and/or Shogi)
* Languages (Russian, Japanese)
* Music, music composition and music production
* Good books and podcast recommendations
* Cooking (goddamn I enjoy Onigiris)

But don't you dare to forget about the a priori information when making conclusions.
What are you looking at right now? A blog. Which means that even though the chance is high
I will blog about the topics described above, it can be literally anything. So yeah. Let's see 
what the future holds and the posterior entries that will be written by future me.

Oh yeah, I have a tendency to write around stuff and not come to the point right away.
Sorry for that. I'm working on it, not only personally but also in terms of time management. 

As Mark Twain once said, 
> I didn't have time to write you a short letter, so I wrote you a long one.

Enjoy your stay.

Oh, and I'm partially driven by this discussion and article about blogging on HN. Take a look. It's interesting to read about the blogging culture in past times. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28591880.
